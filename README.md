# MeetMind
A Multi-Agent AI System that Fetches Meet Transcripts, Generates MoM, Extracts Action Items, Saves to Drive, Sends Email Updates &amp; Creates Calendar Tasks.

**📌 Overview**  
MeetMind is an intelligent, fully automated Minutes-of-Meeting (MoM) generator built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and powered by Gemini 2.0 models.  

It uses a multi-agent architecture to:  

-  Fetch Google Meet transcripts automatically  
- Clean & format raw transcript text  
- Generate a professional MoM  
- Extract action items with deadlines & assignees  
- Save MoM to Google Drive  
- Email attendees the final MoM  
- Add tasks/reminders to Google Calendar  

MeetMind transforms online meeting chaos into structured, actionable information — autonomously.  

**🚀 Why This Project?**  
Meetings produce valuable information but capturing, formatting, storing, and distributing it is slow and error-prone when done manually. Traditional automation scripts cannot interpret long transcripts, extract tasks intelligently, or handle multi-step reasoning.  

MeetMind solves this by using agentic AI:  

- Multi-agent collaboration  
- LLM reasoning for complex text  
- Tool calling for Gmail, Drive, Calendar  
- Long-running operations  
- Context-aware workflow  
- Memory-enabled continuity  
This is more than automation — it’s intelligent orchestration.
